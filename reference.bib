abstract = "Peer review systems are based on evaluating a scholarly work, referred to as a proposal, by experts in that field. In such a system, we consider the reviewer assignment problem, i.e., the problem of assigning proposals to reviewers under the assumption that each reviewer returns her preferences using ordinal rankings. Motivated by the problem defined in Cook et al. (Management Science, 51:655–661, 2005), we focus on reviewer assignments so as to maximize the total number of pairwise comparisons of proposals while ensuring a balanced coverage of distinct pairs of proposals. We propose an alternative mixed integer linear programming formulation for the reviewer assignment problem. In contrast to the optimization model proposed by Cook et al. (2005), the size of our formulation is polynomial in the input size. We present a semidefinite programming relaxation of our optimization model. Furthermore, we propose an optimization based heuristic approach, in which an optimal solution of the linear programming relaxation or the semidefinite programming relaxation of our optimization model is rounded in a straightforward fashion, followed by a local improvement scheme based on pairwise exchanges of proposals. Our computational results illustrate the effectiveness of our optimization model and our heuristic approach."

abstract = "We consider the problem of fairly matching the left-hand vertices of a bipartite graph to the right-hand vertices. We refer to this problem as the optimal semi-matching problem; it is a relaxation of the known bipartite matching problem. We present a way to evaluate the quality of a given semi-matching and show that, under this measure, an optimal semi-matching balances the load on the right-hand vertices with respect to any Lp-norm. In particular, when modeling a job assignment system, an optimal semi-matching achieves the minimal makespan and the minimal flow time for the system. The problem of finding optimal semi-matchings is a special case of certain scheduling problems for which known solutions exist. However, these known solutions are based on general network optimization algorithms, and are not the most efficient way to solve the optimal semi-matching problem. To compute optimal semi-matchings efficiently, we present and analyze two new algorithms. The first algorithm generalizes the Hungarian method for computing maximum bipartite matchings, while the second, more efficient algorithm is based on a new notion of cost-reducing paths. Our experimental results demonstrate that the second algorithm is vastly superior to using known network optimization algorithms to solve the optimal semi-matching problem. Furthermore, this same algorithm can also be used to find maximum bipartite matchings and is shown to be roughly as efficient as the best known algorithms for this goal."

abstract="Finding the closest pair among a given set of points under Hamming Metric is a fundamental problem with many applications. Let n be the number of points and D the dimensionality of all points. We show that for 0{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}D{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}n0.294, the problem, with the binary alphabet set, can be solved within time complexity {\$}O{\backslash}left(n^{\{}2+o(1){\}}{\backslash}right){\$}, whereas for n0.294{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}D{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}n, it can be solved within time complexity {\$}O{\backslash}left(n^{\{}1.843{\}} D^{\{}0.533{\}}{\backslash}right){\$}. We also provide an alternative approach not involving algebraic matrix multiplication, which has the time complexity {\$}O{\backslash}left(n^2D/{\backslash}log^2 D{\backslash}right){\$}with small constant, and is effective for practical use. Moreover, for arbitrary large alphabet set, an algorithm with the time complexity {\$}O{\backslash}left(n^2{\backslash}sqrt{\{}D{\}}{\backslash}right){\$}is obtained for 0{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}D{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}n0.294, whereas the time complexity is {\$}O{\backslash}left(n^{\{}1.921{\}} D^{\{}0.767{\}}{\backslash}right){\$}for n0.294{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}D{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}n.

abstract="The Maximum (Node-) Weight Connected Subgraph Problem (MWCS) searches for a connected subgraph with maximum total weight in a node-weighted (di)graph. In this work we introduce a new integer linear programming formulation built on node variables only, which uses new constraints based on node-separators. We theoretically compare its strength to previously used MIP models in the literature and study the connected subgraph polytope associated with our new formulation. In our computational study we compare branch-and-cut implementations of the new model with two models recently proposed in the literature: one of them using the transformation into the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree problem, and the other one working on the space of node variables only. The obtained results indicate that the new formulation outperforms the previous ones in terms of the running time and in terms of the stability with respect to variations of node weights.",

It has also been shown that both the RMQ and LCA problems can be solved in linear preprocessing time and constant query time under the unit-cost RAM model. This paper studies a new query problem arising from the analysis of biological sequences. Specifically, we wish to answer queries of the form: “Given indices i and j, what is the maximum-sum segment of A[i…j]?” We establish the linear equivalence relation between RMQ and this new problem. As a consequence, we can solve the new query problem in linear preprocessing time and constant query time under the unit-cost RAM model. We then present alternative linear-time solutions for two other biological sequence analysis problems to demonstrate the utilities of the techniques developed in this paper."

abstract = {For an undirected graph G=(V,E), the edge connectivity values between every pair of nodes of G can be succinctly recorded in a flow-equivalent tree that contains the edge connectivity value for a linear number of pairs of nodes. We generalize this result to show how we can efficiently recover a maximum set of disjoint paths between any pair of nodes of G by storing such sets for a linear number of pairs of nodes. At the heart of our result is an observation that combining two flow solutions of the same value, one between nodes s and r and the second between nodes r and t, into a feasible flow solution of value f between nodes s and t, is equivalent to solving a stable matching problem on a bipartite multigraph. Our observation, combined with an observation of Chazelle, leads to a data structure, which takes O(n3.5) time to generate, that can construct the maximum number $\lambda$(u,v) of edge-disjoint paths between any pair (u,v) of nodes in time O($\alpha$(n,n)$\lambda$(u,v)n) time.},

Both the problems of finding axis-parallel squares and rectangles, and arbitrarily oriented squares and rectangles are studied. Efficient algorithms are obtained for all of them. Furthermore, we investigate the generalizations tod-dimensional space, where the problem is to find hyperrectangles and hypercubes. Also, upper and lower bounds are given for combinatorial problems on the maxium number of subsets of size 4, of which the points are the vertices of a square or rectangle. Then we state an equivalence between the problem of finding rectangles, and the problem of findingK2, 2 subgraphs in bipartite graphs. Thus we immediately have an efficient algorithm for this graph problem.",

abstract="In this paper, we study the problems of enumerating cuts of a graph by non-decreasing weights. There are four problems, depending on whether the graph is directed or undirected, and on whether we consider all cuts of the graph or only s-t cuts for a given pair of vertices s,t. Efficient algorithms for these problems with                                                                           \${\backslash}tilde\{O\}(n^\{2\}m)\$                 delay between two successive outputs have been known since 1992, due to Vazirani and Yannakakis. In this paper, improved algorithms are presented. The delays of the presented algorithms are O(nmlog\thinspace(n                        2/m)). Vazirani and Yannakakis's algorithms have been used as basic subroutines in the solutions of many problems. Therefore, our improvement immediately reduces the running time of these solutions. For example, for the minimum k-cut problem, the upper bound is immediately reduced by a factor of                                                                           \${\backslash}tilde\{O\}(n)\$                 for k=3,4,5,6.",

abstract="Given a set of n sticks of various (not necessarily different) lengths, what is the largest length so that we can cut k equally long pieces of this length from the given set of sticks? We analyze the structure of this problem and show that it essentially reduces to a single call of a selection algorithm; we thus obtain an optimal linear-time algorithm. This algorithm also solves the related envy-free stick-division problem, which Segal-Halevi et al. (ACM Trans Algorithms 13(1):1--32, 2016. ISSN: 15496325.                 https://doi.org/10.1145/2988232                              ) recently used as their central primitive operation for the first discrete and bounded envy-free cake cutting protocol with a proportionality guarantee when pieces can be put to waste.",
