title: "Zero-Freeness is All You Need: A Weitz-Type FPTAS for the Entire Lee–Yang Zero-Free Region"
authors: [Shuai Shao, Ke Shi]
type: conference
year: 2025
pub: ITCS
abstract: >
    We present a Weitz-type FPTAS for the ferromagnetic Ising model across the entire Lee–Yang zero-free region, without relying on the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property. Our algorithm is Weitz-type for two reasons. First, it expresses the partition function as a telescoping product of ratios, with the key being to approximate each ratio. Second, it uses Weitz’s self-avoiding walk tree, and truncates it at logarithmic depth to give a good and efficient approximation. The key difference from the standard Weitz algorithm is that we approximate a carefully designed edge-deletion ratio instead of the marginal probability of a vertex’s spin, ensuring our algorithm does not require SSM.
    <br />
    Furthermore, by establishing local dependence of coefficients (LDC), we indeed prove a novel form of SSM for these edge-deletion ratios, which, in turn, implies the standard SSM for the random cluster model. This is the first SSM result for the random cluster model on general graphs, beyond lattices. We prove LDC using a new division relation, and remarkably, such relations hold quite universally. As a result, we establish LDC for a variety of models. Combined with existing zero-freeness results for these models, we derive new SSM results for them. Our work suggests that both Weitz-type FPTASes and SSM can be derived from zero-freeness, while zero-freeness alone suffices for Weitz-type FPTASes, SSM additionally requires LDC, a combinatorial property independent of zero-freeness.

title: "An Optimal Algorithm for the Stacker Crane Problem on Fixed Topologies"
type: conference
year: 2025
pub: ISAAC
abstract: >
    The Stacker Crane Problem (SCP) is a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem. In SCP, pairs of pickup and delivery points are designated on a graph,
    and a crane must visit these points to move objects from each pickup location to its respective delivery point. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled.
    SCP is known to be NP-hard, even on tree structures. The only positive results, in terms of polynomial-time solvability, apply to graphs that are topologically equivalent to a path or a cycle.
    We propose an algorithm that is optimal for each fixed topology, running in near-linear time. This is achieved by demonstrating that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by both the cycle rank and the number of branch vertices.

title: Almost optimum $\ell$-covering of $\Z_n$
type: conference
show: [d]
pub: COCOON
year: 2024
authors: [Ke Shi, Chao Xu]
abstract: >
  A subset $B$ of ring $\Z_n$ is called a $\ell$-covering set if $\{ ab \pmod n \mid 0\leq a \leq \ell, b\in B\} = \Z_n$.
  We show there exists a $\ell$-covering set of $\Z_n$ of size $O(\frac{n}{\ell}\log n)$ for all $n$ and $\ell$, and how to construct such set.
  We also show examples where any $\ell$-covering set must have size $\Omega(\frac{n}{\ell}\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$. The proof uses a refined bound for relative totient function obtained through sieve theory, and existence of a large divisor with linear divisor sum.

title: A Polynomial Time Algorithm for Finding a Minimum 4-Partition of a Submodular Function
authors: [Tsuyoshi Hirayama, Yuhao Liu, Kazuhisa Makino, Ke Shi, Chao Xu]
type: conference
year: 2023
pub: SODA

abstract: >
  In this paper, we study the minimum $k$-partition problem of submodular functions, i.e., 
  given a finite set $V$ and a submodular function $f:2^V\to \R$,  
  computing a $k$-partition $ \{ V_1, \ldots, V_k \}$ of $V$ 
  with minimum $\sum_{i=1}^k f(V_i)$.  
  The problem is a natural generalization of the minimum $k$-cut problem in graphs and hypergraphs. 
  It is known that the problem is NP-hard for general $k$, and solvable in polynomial time for $k \leq 3$.  
  In this paper, we construct the first polynomial-time algorithm for the minimum $4$-partition problem.

title: "Strong spatial mixing for the matching polynomial: A simple proof via Heilmann-Lieb Theorem"
authors: [Shuai Shao, Ke Shi]
type: manuscript
year: 2025
bib: 2025, Submitted.
abstract: >
    We study the connections between strong spatial mixing and zero-freeness, the two main notions used to devise deterministic approximation algorithms for counting problems. 
    Following a recent framework introduced by [Regts, G. (2023). Absence of zeros implies strong spatial mixing. Probability Theory and Related Fields, 186(1), 621-641.] for the vertex model, we show that the implication from zero-freeness of the partition function to strong spatial mixing also works for the matching polynomial, a typical counting problem in the edge model.  
    Based on Heilmann and Lieb's results, a zero-free region $C_\Delta=\C \backslash (-\infty,-\frac{1}{4(\Delta-1)}]$ of the partition function and a Christoffel--Darboux type identity, we give a very simple proof for strong spatial mixing of the matching polynomial on graphs of degree bounded by $\Delta$ with any complex edge parameter $z \in C_\Delta$.
    This proof does not rely on the tree recursion which is commonly used  for proving strong spatial mixing in previous results.
