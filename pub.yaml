title: A Polynomial Time Algorithm for Finding a Minimum 4-Partition of a Submodular Function
authors: [Tsuyoshi Hirayama, Yuhao Liu, Kazuhisa Makino, Ke Shi, Chao Xu]
type: conference
year: 2023
pub: SODA
selected: true
abstract: >
  In this paper, we study the minimum $k$-partition problem of submodular functions, i.e., 
  given a finite set $V$ and a submodular function $f:2^V\to \R$,  
  computing a $k$-partition $ \{ V_1, \ldots, V_k \}$ of $V$ 
  with minimum $\sum_{i=1}^k f(V_i)$.  
  The problem is a natural generalization of the minimum $k$-cut problem in graphs and hypergraphs. 
  It is known that the problem is NP-hard for general $k$, and solvable in polynomial time for $k \leq 3$.  
  In this paper, we construct the first polynomial-time algorithm for the minimum $4$-partition problem.

title: Almost optimum $\ell$-covering of $\Z_n$
type: conference
show: [d]
pub: COCOON
year: 2024
authors: [Ke Shi, Chao Xu]
abstract: >
  A subset $B$ of ring $\Z_n$ is called a $\ell$-covering set if $\{ ab \pmod n \mid 0\leq a \leq \ell, b\in B\} = \Z_n$.
  We show there exists a $\ell$-covering set of $\Z_n$ of size $O(\frac{n}{\ell}\log n)$ for all $n$ and $\ell$, and how to construct such set.
  We also show examples where any $\ell$-covering set must have size $\Omega(\frac{n}{\ell}\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$. The proof uses a refined bound for relative totient function obtained through sieve theory, and existence of a large divisor with linear divisor sum.

title: From Zero-freeness to Strong Spatial Mixing of Matching Polynomial
authors: [Shuai Shao, Ke Shi]
type: manuscript
year: 2024
bib: 2024, Submitted.
abstract: >
  We study the problem of approximating the matching polynomial on graphs with
  maximum degree $\Delta$ and show that the matching polynomial exhibits strong spatial mixing
  for all complex edge parameter $z \in \C \backslash (-\infty,-\frac{1}{4(\Delta-1)}]$. Additionally,
  we provide a FPTAS for approximating the matching polynomial using correlation decay.
