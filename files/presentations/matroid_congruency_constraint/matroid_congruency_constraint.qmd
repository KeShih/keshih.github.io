## Combinatorial search problem

$\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}$
$\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}$
$\newcommand{\N}{\mathbb{N}}$

 - A groundset of elements $E$ 
 - Feasible sets $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^E$
 - Find an element in the feasible set

## Combinatorial search problem with congruency constraint

::: {.incremental}
 - $\Z_k=\{0,\ldots,k-1\}$. Addition is defined as $a+b = a+b \pmod k$.
 - Given a label function $\ell:E\to \Z_k$ and $b\in \Z_k$. Let $\ell(X)=\sum_{x\in X}\ell(x)$.
 - $b$-feasible sets are $\mathcal{F}_b = \{\ell(F) =  b | F\in \mathcal{F}\}$. 
 - Goal: find a set in $\mathcal{F}_b$.
 - When $k=2$, we call it parity constraint.
:::

## Alternative formulation for parity constraint

- A set of red elements $R\subseteq E$.
- Find a feasible set with odd (even) number of red elements.

## Major Question {background-color="aquamarine"}

For what kind of feasible family $\mathcal{F}$, is search over $\mathcal{F}_b$ is easy?

   - Undirected graphs: Reduce to matching
   - Directed graphs: [@RobertsonST99]
 - a cycle of length divisible by $3$.
   - OPEN!
 - a directed cycle of length $1 \pmod 3$.
   - NP-hard! [@APY91]

- $\mathcal{F}=2^E$.
- Find a subset of elements that sums to $b \pmod k$.
- Standard dynamic programming algorithm with running time $O(nk)$.

## Matroid

## Zero Base Problem
Given a matroid $M$ and $\ell:E\to \Z_k$. Find a base $B$ such that $\ell(B)=0$.
:::

::: {.incremental}
 - Label sum $0$ is for convenience. 
 - Folklore algorithm: Reduce to $n^{O(k)}$ matroid intersection.
 - Does this problem have a pseudopolynomial time algorithm [@PapadimitriouY82]?
 - Is the problem in FPT with respect to $k$?
:::

## Our result

::: {.callout-note}
## Theorem (Combinatorial)
If $k$ is a prime power or product of two primes, then for any base $B$, if there exists a zero base, then there exists a zero base $D$ such that $|B\setminus D|\leq k-1$.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Theorem (Algorithm)
If $k$ is a prime power or product of two primes, then there exists an algorithm to find a zero base in a $\Z_k$ labelled matroid of $n$ elements in $O((2k-1)^{k-1}n^c)$ time.
:::

Zero base problem is FPT!

## Matroid backgrounds

- Let $M=(E,\mathcal{I})$ is a set system. 
- $\mathcal{I}\subseteq 2^E$ are the independent sets.
- The rank of $X\subseteq E$ is $r(X) = \max \{ |I| \mid I\subseteq X, I\in \mathcal{I} \}$.


## Matroid backgrounds

- $\mathcal{B}$ the set of bases are the maximal independent sets.
- $M=(E,\mathcal{I})$ is a matroid if 
   - $\mathcal{B}$ is non-empty
   - If $A,B\in \mathcal{B}$, then for every $a\in A\setminus B$, there exists $b\in B\setminus A$ such that $A-a+b\in \mathcal{B}$.

## Matroid backgrounds

::: {.callout-note}
## Definition (Partition Matroid)
A matroid $M=(E,\mathcal{I})$ is a partition matroid if there is a partition $E_1,\ldots,E_k$ of $E$ and capacities $a_1,\ldots,a_k$, such that a set $I$ is independent if and only if $|I\cap E_i|\leq a_i$.
:::

![](partition_matroid.png){fig-align="center"}

## Matroid backgrounds

::: {.callout-note}
## Definition (Matroid Intersection)
For two matroids $M_1=(E,\mathcal{I}_1)$ and $M_2=(E,\mathcal{I}_2)$, the matroid intersection $M=M_1\cap M_2$ is the set system $M=(E,\mathcal{I}_1 \cap \mathcal{I}_2)$.
:::

Optimization over matroid intersection takes polynomial time.

## Folklore algorithm

::: {.incremental}
  - $E_i = \{ e \mid e\in E, \ell(e)=i\}$.
  - Enumerate all $a_0,\ldots,a_{k-1}$ such that $\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i\cdot a_i = 0$, and $0\leq a_i\leq |E_i|$
  - For each $a_0,\ldots,a_{k-1}$, run matroid intersection between $M$ and the partition matroid over the partition $E_0,\ldots,E_{k-1}$ with capacities $a_0,\ldots,a_{k-1}$.
  - return the result of any feasible matroid intersection.
- Correctness: If $B$ be the zero base, then it would be found by the matroid intersection with capacities $|E_0\cap B|,\ldots,|E_{k-1}\cap B|$.
:::

## Simpler algorithm

 - Hard to explain to anyone who never seen matroid intersection before.
 - Can we handle parity case with an easier algorithm?

## Structural theorem for parity

::: {.callout-note}
## Lemma (Brualdi 1969)
Let $B$ and $D$ be bases, then there exists a bijection $f:B\setminus D\to D\setminus B$, such that for all $e\in B\setminus D$, $B-e+f(e)$ is a base.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Theorem
If a matroid has a zero base in $\Z_2$, then for any base $B$, there exists an zero base $D$ such that $|B\setminus D|\leq 1$.
:::

Proof: If $B$ is a zero base, then we are done. Otherwise, $B$ is a $1$ base, then consider a bijection $f:B\setminus D \to D\setminus B$. At least 1 $e\in B\setminus D$, $\ell(f(e))+\ell(e) = 1$. $B-e+f(e)$ is a zero base.

## Parity constraint zero base

The algorithm for finding a zero base over $\Z_2$.

 1. Find any base $B$, if it is an zero base, return $B$.
 2. If it is not an zero base, then find a pair $e\in B$ and $f\not\in B$, such that $\ell(e)+\ell(f)=1$, $B-e+f$ is a base. Return $B-e+f$.
 3. Otherwise, no such base exists.

## What about larger modulus?

::: {.callout-tip}
## Definition (Strongly Base-orderable Matroid)
A matroid is strongly base-orderable, if for any bases $B$ and $D$, there exists a bijection $f:B\setminus D\to D\setminus B$, such that for all $X\subseteq B\setminus D$, $B-X+f(X)$ is a base.
:::

Similar proof show

::: {.callout-note}
## Theorem
If a strongly base-orderable matroid has a zero base, then for any base $B$, there exists an zero base $D$ such that $|B\setminus D|\leq k-1$.
:::


## A sensible conjecture 

::: {.callout-note}
## Proximity Conjecture
If the matroid has a zero base in $\Z_k$. Let $B$ be the a base, there exists a zero base $D$ such that $|B\setminus D|\leq k-1$.
:::

## $k-1$ is the best possible

 ![](block.png){fig-align="center"}

 - A block matroid is a matroid where $E$ can be partitioned into two bases (called blocks).
 - Note for any base $D$, $\ell(D\setminus B) = |D\setminus B|\pmod k$. 


## Implications of the conjecture
A $O(n^{2(k-1)})$ time algorithm:

 - Find any base $B$
 - For $k'\leq k-1$
   - For each $S$ a subset $B$ of size $k'$, $T$ a subset of $E\setminus B$ of size $k'$
     - Test if $(B\setminus S)\cup T$ is a zero base, if so, return.
 - No zero base exists



## FPT algorithm given conjecture is true

- Find a base $B$, and let $v = (|E_0\cap B|,\ldots,|E_{k-1}\cap B|)$.
- For every $u$ such that $\|v-u\|_1 \leq k-1$ and $\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i \cdot u_i = b$, we compute the matroid intesection of $M$ and $M'$, a partition matroid over $E_0,\ldots,E_{k-1}$ with capacities $u_0,\ldots,u_{k-1}$.
- Output a common base.

Total running time is $(2k-1)^k$ times matroid intersection.

## Observations

::: {.callout-note}
# Conjecture (Strong Proximity)
Let $B$ be any base, for each $b\in \Z_k$, if there exists a base $D'$ such that $\ell(D')=b$, then there exists a base $D$ such that $\ell(D)=b$ and $|B\setminus D|\leq k-1$.
:::

Observations:

 - Minimal counterexample would be a block matroid of rank $k$
 - $B$ and $D$ are disjoint.
 - $\ell(D')$ is unique, that is no other base $D$ has $\ell(D)=b$.

A labelling isolates a base, if no other base has the same label sum.

## Combinatorial characterization

Our main conjecture equivalent to the following:

::: {.callout-note}
# Conjecture (Isolation)
For every block matroid of rank $k$, there is no $\Z_k$ labelling that isolates a block. 
:::

For a fixed $k$, number of block matroid of rank $k$ is finite. 
One can check the theorem is true for small $k$!

We've tested for $k=2,3,4,5$, all of which are true. 


## Prime case

::: {.callout-note}
# Theorem (Isolation)
Let $p$ be a prime. For every block matroid of rank $p$, there is no $\Z_p$ labelling that isolates a block. 
:::

## Proof
Consider disjoint bases $B$ and $D$.

. . .

A pair $e\in D$ and $e'\not\in D$ is called trivially exchangeable, if $\ell(e)=\ell(e')$ and $D-e+e'$ is a base.

. . .

If $D$ has a trivially exchangeable pair, then we are done.


## Proof
If $D$ does not have a trivially exchangable pair with label $i$, then we claim $r(E_i) = r(E_i\cap B)+r(E_i\cap D)$. 

::: {.callout-note}
# Theorem [@SchrijverS90]
Let $M$ be a matroid with bases $\mathcal{B}$, let $p$ be a prime number, $\ell:E\to \Z_p$ a label function. 

$$|\ell(\mathcal{B})|\geq \min\{p, \sum_{i\in \Z_p} r(E_i-r(M)+1)\}.$$
:::

## 
Pick a $e\in D$, and consider the matroid $M'=M-e$.
$$\begin{aligned}
&\left(\sum_{i\in \Z_p} r(E_i)\right) - r(M')+1\\
\geq& \left(\sum_{i\in \Z_p,\ell(e)\neq i} r(E_i\cap B) + r(E_i\cap D) \right)\\
    & + r(E_{\ell(e)}\cap B) + (r(E_{\ell(e)}\cap D)-1) - p + 1\\
=& 2p-p \\
=& p\\
\end{aligned}$$
$M'$ has a base of every sum. There is a base $D'$ in $M'$ s.t $\ell(D')=\ell(D)$, which is also a base in $M$.

## Generalizations

::: {.callout-tip}
# Conjecture (Schrijver-Seymour) 
Let $M$ be a matroid with bases $\mathcal{B}$, let $G$ be an abelian group and $\ell:E\to G$ a label function. If $H=Stab(\ell(M))$, then 
$$|\ell(\mathcal{B})|\geq |H|\cdot (\sum_{Q\in R/H} r(\ell^{-1}(Q))-r(M)+1)).$$
:::
. . .

::: {.callout-note}
# Theorem (Liu-X) 
For any group $G$ where Schrijver-Seymour conjecture is true, and a zero base exists, then for any base $B$, there is a zero base $D$ such that $|B\setminus D|\leq |G|-1$.
:::

## Main result

::: {.callout-note}
# Theorem [@devos2009generalization]
Schrijver-Seymour conjecture is true if $|G|=pq$ or $G=\Z_{p^k}$, for prime $p$ and $q$.
:::

:::  {.callout-note}
# Theorem
Let $k$ be a power of a prime, or product of two primes. For a matroid $M$, let $B$ be a base, for each $b\in \Z_k$, if $D'$ such that $\ell(D')=b$, then there exists a base $D$ such that $\ell(D)=b$ and and $|B\setminus D|\leq k-1$.
:::

## Open Problems

::: {.callout-tip}
## Conjecture (Proximity for Optimization)
For any optimum base $B$, either there exists an optimum zero base $D$ such that $|B\setminus D|\leq k-1$, or there is no zero base.
:::

We verified this is true for $\Z_3$ and $\Z_4$.

## Open Problems

$D(G)$, the Davenport constant of a group $G$, is the smallest number that any set of size $D(G)$ must contain a non-empty subset that sums to 0.

$D(G)$ can be much smaller than $|G|$, but $D(G)=|G|$ if $G=\Z_k$.

::: {.callout-note}
## Theorem
Let $G$ be a group and $M$ be a strongly base-orderable matroid. For any optimum base $B$, either there exists a optimum zero base $D$, such that $|B\setminus D|\leq D(G)-1$, or there is no zero base.
:::

Does the above theorem generalize to all matroids?
