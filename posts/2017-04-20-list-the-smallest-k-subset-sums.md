{Problem}

    Given a set of positive reals $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ where $x_1<x_2<\ldots<x_n$, 
    find the smallest $k$ subset sums.

Torsten Gross and Nils BlÃ¼thgen posted [a $O(k^2)$ time solution on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05795).

We show a $O(k\log k)$ time algorithm, which is optimal if we want to output the numbers in order.

The idea is that we list sums one by one, and maintain what sum to pick next through a priority queue. We start with the empty set. Assume that we added the sum induced by $I\subset [n]$ (that is, $\sum_{i\in I} x_i$) into the output, let $j=1+\max I$. Now we can consider two possibilities by extending the current solution: the sum induced by $I\cup \{j\}$ will be in the output, the sum induced by $I\cup \{k\}$ where $k>j$ will be in the output. We will add both possibilities to the queue so that one can check them later.
Also, there is no need actually to store the sets, only the values.

Here is a quick python implementation. 

```python
def first_k_subset_sums(x,k):
    n = len(x)
    h = []
    output = []
    heapq.heappush(h,(x[0],0))
    while h and len(output)<k:
        (u,b) = heapq.heappop(h)
        output.append(u)
        if b+1<n:
            heapq.heappush(h,(u+x[b+1],b+1))
            heapq.heappush(h,((u-x[b])+x[b+1],b+1))
    return output
```
