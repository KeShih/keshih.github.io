Cost basis is the original value of an asset. 
When every transaction is between a single currency and asset. It is fairly easy to compute the cost basis.
Indeed, when one buys a stock, the cost basis is precisely the market value of that stock.

A single number is sufficient to record the cost basis.

However, things become complicated when there is no known market value.
Or, when one cannot determin the market value.

In that case, we can still store the *exchange rate* for a particular transaction.

Let $D$ be the set of $n$ different commodities, and we have vectors $\R^D$.

A transaction is just a vector $(v_1,\ldots,v_n) \in \R^D$.
