        <br />
<div>
<p>I have done many Haskell exercises, however, I have never done anything that have a engineering flavor, i.e. useful in real life.</p>
<p>I saw this challenge and believe it's the perfect chance to practice my real life Haskell skills AND get a t-shirt. <a href="https://github.com/chaoxu/mgccl-haskell/blob/master/random/unshredder.hs">The code on github</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is not well defined. Therefore I gave the following abstraction:</p>
<p>Each image is of a vertex. One construct a weighted directed graph and want to find a certain kind of path that visit all vertices.</p>
<p>What do we want to find?</p>
<p>The shortest path that visit every vertex? That would be TSP and NP-Hard.</p>
<p>However I would believe the better idea is:</p>
<p>Find a path that go though every vertex and minimize the maximal weight in the path.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure this is also NP-complete too. Thus I will just use a greedy algorithm and assume real life data are easy.</p>
<p>I used a simple scheme to calculate the closeness between two strips: compare the last column of a strip with the first column of another strip. This decision come from my familiarity with lists instead of arrays. However, smarter move would be taking the average of a larger set of surrounding and see how each side deviates from it.</p>
<p>The function I used to calculate the difference is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sum_{i=1}^n (\sum_{j=0}^3 |a_{i,j}-b_{i,j}|)^{1/4}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(a_{i,j}\)</span> is the value of the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>th channel of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th pixel in the first strip's last column.</p>
<p>Which strip is the left most strip? Try all of them!</p>
<p>Running time of my algorithm is <span class="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span>, as it cost <span class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span> time to find a path with minimum weight starting from a specific vertex. Of course it can be improved to <span class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span> if I pick any vertex and expand it both ways instead of just connecting things to the right.</p>
<p>To find the optimal strip width, it is easy if one have the following assumption:</p>
<p>If the strip width is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the average difference between strips will be larger than strip width of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(m\neq kn\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Note it is possible that for strip width of <span class="math inline">\(2k\)</span> to have a higher average than <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>One can implement an algorithm on a DAG to figure this out. I was too tired so I just pick the top <span class="math inline">\(i=5\)</span> strip widths and computed the <span class="math inline">\(\gcd\)</span> instead.</p>
<p>The code is slow, I have no idea why because I'm not experienced in how to reason about efficiency in Haskell.</p>
